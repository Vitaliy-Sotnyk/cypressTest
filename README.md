## Setup

### Step 1 - Dependencies

You will need:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 10.x)

Please install them if you don't have them already.

### Step 2 - Clone the repository:

From the command line, clone the repository using the url: https://github.com/Vitaliy-Sotnyk/cypressTest.git.

### Step 3 - Install dependencies

```sh
$ cd PROJECT_DIRECTORY
$ npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies for all the tasks, _it might take a while_.

### Step 3 - Run cypress

```sh
$ npm run cy_open
```
Run this command and wait until the next image wouldn't open:
![form](./imgs/welcome_to_Cypress.png)

When this window would be opened, press on the "E2E Testing" box.
After that, you should see the window where you could choose one of the browsers which will be created a test simulation.
![form](./imgs/choose_a_browser.png)
As for me, I always use Chrome)

When the browser will be opened you could see the next window: 
![form](./imgs/specs.png)
Here you need just press on the main.cy.js and wait. The test will be run automatically.
